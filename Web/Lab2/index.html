        <p>It was founded as (monkey)Business by players Fly and Notail, who were former players from Team 
            Secret, in August 2015. Soon after a dominating run through the European qualifiers for the 
            Frankfurt Major, they adopted the moniker OG. They went on to win the inaugural Dota 2 Major 
            Championship in Frankfurt in November 2015, earning US$one million in prize money. Despite 
            placing in the bottom half of the next Major in Shanghai in March 2016, the team would rebound 
            and take first place at the Manila Major in June 2016, becoming the first team to repeat as 
            champions of a Valve Corporation sponsored Dota 2 tournament.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Following that, OG won the Kiev Major in a best of five series against Virtus.pro. 
            At the Kiev event, the team made an appearance on Valve's True Sight documentary series. 
            In May 2018, the organization signed James "Swedish Delight" 
            Liu to represent the Super Smash Bros. scene OG entered The International 2016 as one of the favorites after earning a direct invite, but 
            ended up finishing 9-12th out of 16 teams.
        </p>
        
        <p> In August 2016, founding members MoonMeander, 
            Miracle-, and Cr1t- left the team, with s4, ana, and JerAx replacing them.Despite 
            the new roster, OG won the Boston Major in December 2016, giving them their third Dota 2 Major 
            championship. For the first premier tournament following Boston, OG advanced to the grand 
            finals of the Dota 2 Asia Championships in Shanghai, where they were swept in a best-of-five 
            series against Invictus Gaming.

        <p>The International 2018 (TI8) was the eighth iteration of The International, an annual Dota 2 eSports 
            world championship tournament. Hosted by Valve Corporation, the game's developer, TI8 followed a 
            year-long series of tournaments awarding qualifying points, known as the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC), 
            with the top eight ranking teams being directly invited to the tournament. In addition, ten more 
            teams earned invites through qualifiers that were held in June 2018, with the group stage and main 
            event played at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver in August.
        </p>
        <p>The best-of-five grand finals took place between OG and PSG.LGD, with OG winning the series 3â€“2. 
            Their victory was considered a Cinderella and underdog success story, as they had came from the open 
            qualifiers and were not favored in matches throughout the competition.
        </p>
        <p>As with every International from 2013 onwards, the prize pool was crowdfunded by the Dota 2 
            community via its battle pass feature, with the total being over US$25 million, making it the 
            largest for a single eSports tournament in history. Other events took place during the tournament, 
            including a cosplay competition and submitted short film contest with their own independent prize 
            pools, as well as two live demonstration games of a team of professional players playing against a 
            team of five OpenAI-curated bots, known as the OpenAI Five, to showcase the capability of machine 
            learning. In addition to nearly 20,000 spectators at the Rogers Arena, the tournament was 
            livestreamed and seen by over 15 million people online.

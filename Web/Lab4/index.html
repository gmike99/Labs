                        Secret, in August 2015. Soon after a dominating run through the European qualifiers for the
                        Frankfurt Major, they adopted the moniker OG. They went on to win the inaugural Dota 2 Major
                        Championship in Frankfurt in November 2015, earning US$one million in prize money. Despite
                        placing in the bottom half of the next Major in Shanghai in March 2016, the team would rebound
                        and take first place at the Manila Major in June 2016, becoming the first team to repeat as
                        champions of a Valve Corporation sponsored Dota 2 tournament.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Following that, OG won the Kiev Major in a best of five series against Virtus.pro.
                        At the Kiev event, the team made an appearance on Valve's True Sight documentary series.
                        In May 2018, the organization signed James "Swedish Delight"
                        Liu to represent the Super Smash Bros. scene OG entered The International 2016 as one of the favorites after earning a direct invite, but
                        ended up finishing 9-12th out of 16 teams.
                    </p>

                    <p> In August 2016, founding members MoonMeander,
                        Miracle-, and Cr1t- left the team, with s4, ana, and JerAx replacing them.Despite
                        the new roster, OG won the Boston Major in December 2016, giving them their third Dota 2 Major
                        championship. For the first premier tournament following Boston, OG advanced to the grand
                        finals of the Dota 2 Asia Championships in Shanghai, where they were swept in a best-of-five
                        series against Invictus Gaming.

                    <p>The International 2018 (TI8) was the eighth iteration of The International, an annual Dota 2 eSports
                        world championship tournament. Hosted by Valve Corporation, the game's developer, TI8 followed a
                        year-long series of tournaments awarding qualifying points, known as the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC),
                        with the top eight ranking teams being directly invited to the tournament. In addition, ten more
                        teams earned invites through qualifiers that were held in June 2018, with the group stage and main
                        event played at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver in August.
                    </p>
                    <p>The best-of-five grand finals took place between OG and PSG.LGD, with OG winning the series 3â€“2.
                        Their victory was considered a Cinderella and underdog success story, as they had came from the open
                        qualifiers and were not favored in matches throughout the competition.
                    </p>
                    <p>As with every International from 2013 onwards, the prize pool was crowdfunded by the Dota 2
                        community via its battle pass feature, with the total being over US$25 million, making it the
                        largest for a single eSports tournament in history. Other events took place during the tournament,
                        including a cosplay competition and submitted short film contest with their own independent prize
                        pools, as well as two live demonstration games of a team of professional players playing against a
                        team of five OpenAI-curated bots, known as the OpenAI Five, to showcase the capability of machine
                        learning. In addition to nearly 20,000 spectators at the Rogers Arena, the tournament was
                        livestreamed and seen by over 15 million people online.
